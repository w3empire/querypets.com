            <p>Our winged pet is capable of making different types of sounds with its beak. Over time we started to notice that they use these sounds to communicate with us. When we are more used to the presence of our parakeet, it is even possible to understand what they want when they make some sounds.</p>
<p>One of the most characteristic sounds that parakeets make with their beak is clicking. The beak clicking can lead the pet owner to wonder if this is a normal behavior.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with our feathered friend? Shall we find out together?</p>
<p>In this short article we are going to explore together some of the reasons why your parakeet is making that clicking sound with its beak. Later we will also see other sounds that your bird can make to communicate with you or express some feeling.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-my-parakeet-clicking-its-beak">Why is my parakeet clicking its beak?</h2>
<p><strong>Happiness. This is a sign that the parakeet is happy to see you and comfortable with your presence. The snap of the beak or the clicking noise that the parakeet makes, represents a greeting when seeing you. He is pleased that you are here and that he can spend time with you.</strong></p>
<p>After bringing your new friend home you start to notice that he has been making this clicking noise with his beak. A very characteristic noise that parakeets make with their beak. It produces this sound by tapping the upper nozzle against the lower nozzle.</p>
<p>There is no specific time for the bird to make this sound. It could be when you enter the environment where the bird is. It can be in the morning, at the first contact with the parakeet. Or even if you leave and go back to where you were with the bird. At any of these times it may click its beak.</p>
<p>Know that you can communicate with your little feathered friend. Try to replicate the clicking sound he makes with his beak at him. This way you show him that you are also happy to see him and spend time with him.</p>
<p><strong>Is this noise made only by parakeets?</strong></p>
<p>No. Other birds may make a sound very similar to the click you are hearing. For example, the African gray parrot uses its throat, while the cockatoo uses its tongue to make the clicking noise.</p>
<p>Regardless of which body part other birds use to make this sound, it is very similar to the parakeet clicking noise.</p>
<p>It is a very common behavior among several species of birds. So there&rsquo;s no need to worry if you often hear your parakeet clicking its beak. It&rsquo;s just a natural form of communication that he uses to express joy at seeing you.</p>
<p>And to tell you the truth, many owners barely hear the clicking noise that the parakeet makes. Many of them do not even know that the bird is capable of producing this sound.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-clicking-noise-normal">Is this clicking noise normal?</h2>
<p>The clicking noise your parakeet makes with its beak is completely normal. It is a sound used by the bird as a form of communication. Usually it means the parakeet is happy to see you. Depending on your bird&rsquo;s personality, it may make this sound more often.</p>
<p>The click of your parakeet&rsquo;s beak means happiness and comfort with your presence. Not only for the parakeet, but for other birds that emit a sound similar to that of the click, the meaning is the same.</p>
<p>The parakeet&rsquo;s beak snapping is a friendly greeting. Usually, he uses this sound when he sees you entering the same room as he is. He can also make this noise to greet another bird.</p>
<p>When you meet your parakeet for the first time, it may approach you and snap its beak, making the characteristic clicking sound. This indicates that your pet likes you and is expressing its approval through that clicking noise.</p>
<p>When the parakeet indicates that he is happy to meet you, make the clicking noise back to him. As a way of indicating that you liked him too.</p>
<p>Even though some other sounds made by the parakeet are more difficult to replicate, the popping sound is much easier for us humans. So, nothing stops you from communicating with your little feathered friend.</p>
<p>To form a much stronger connection with your parakeet, as soon as you enter where the bird is, make a clicking noise to show that you are happy to see him.</p>
<p>Over time and as you live with your parakeet, you will begin to notice other sounds that the bird makes.</p>
<p>You can see that these sounds it makes are indicative of what the bird is feeling. The more familiar you are with the parakeet, the better your ability to recognize what he means by a particular sound.</p>
<p>He can use sounds to express happiness, sadness, fear or to show that something in the environment bothers him.</p>
<p>Also, over time, you can try to reproduce other sounds that the parakeet makes. Creating a form of communication with your bird.</p>
<p>Since this behavior is natural for parakeets, when he clicks his beak at you he is giving you a friendly greeting, and that&rsquo;s a good sign. It indicates that your feathered friend trusts you and feels safe in your presence.</p>
<p>Other sounds the bird makes are also normal. Sounds such as singing, hissing and whistling are part of the parakeet&rsquo;s repertoire. And he will use all these sounds to communicate with you.</p>
<p>To create a stronger bond with your feathered pet, always take the time to play with it when you hear the clicking noise. Keep the parakeet company and show that you are happy to be around him too.</p>
<h2 id="can-the-beak-clicking-harm-my-parakeet">Can the beak clicking harm my parakeet?</h2>
<p>No. The clicking noise emitted by the parakeet is completely natural. He learns to make this noise as a form of communication. The bird copies the behavior of other parakeets that make the same clicking sound.</p>
<p>Some parakeets learn to make the clicking sound with their beak on their own. It is not always necessary for there to be other parakeets around. This sound is very characteristic of parakeets and does not harm the bird.</p>
<p>By understanding that the bird makes these sounds as a form of communication, it is easier for us to accept that the noise made by the bird is not harmful. On the contrary, these noises are essential for the parakeet to express what he is feeling at the moment.</p>
<p>The crackling of the beak also does not indicate that the bird is getting sick or is suffering from any illness. It is completely safe for the parakeet to make this sound. It usually indicates that the bird is happy to see you or to see other birds that are in the same environment.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that not every time the parakeet sees you it will click with its beak. The bird has full control of when it will make this noise or not. So, it depends a lot on your pet&rsquo;s personality and what he&rsquo;s feeling at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-when-my-parakeet-makes-a-clicking-noise">What should I do when my parakeet makes a clicking noise?</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do anything. This noise is normal and they use it to greet their owners. There is no need to act and do anything as the clicking noise with the parakeet&rsquo;s beak does not indicate any problem with the bird. On the contrary, he normally uses this sound to indicate that he is happy.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t need to do anything, you can make a clicking noise back to the parakeet. By doing this, you show him that you are also glad to see him. If your parakeet makes this noise whenever you enter his environment, make the noise back to him as a form of communication.</p>
<p>This moment can be important to create a bond of affection with the pet. The clicking sound you make doesn&rsquo;t have to be loud or exaggerated, a subtle noise is enough.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-other-sounds-my-parakeet-can-make">What are some other sounds my parakeet can make?</h2>
<p>Although parakeets cannot speak, they can make a variety of sounds. These sounds are used for communication with the owner or with other birds. Over time, and with the coexistence with the parakeet, you will realize that its sound repertoire is quite large and the clicking noise is just one of many sounds that the bird can make.</p>
<p>Below I will list some of the most common sounds the parakeet makes to try to communicate and a brief description of what they might mean.</p>
<h3 id="sing-or-whistle">SING OR WHISTLE</h3>
<p>A great indication that the bird is happy.</p>
<p>In a group it is more common to hear the parakeet humming. Of course, if he is comfortable with the presence of other birds.</p>
<p>When the parakeet hums, it is common for him to mix up several sounds that he has learned over the course of his life.</p>
<h3 id="conversation">CONVERSATION</h3>
<p>When you catch your parakeet talking to itself, it indicates to the owner that it is happy and cheerful at that moment. They can talk to each other too. In a group it is more common to witness the parakeets talking.</p>
<p>Conversation can also be used to woo and flirt with a potential love partner or partner.</p>
<h3 id="screams">SCREAMS</h3>
<p>When your parakeet screams, he is trying to get your attention. Something wrong is happening. Screams can be long or short. Normally, the bird screams when it is frightened or injured.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to check that everything is okay with your little feathered friend. If that&rsquo;s okay, you can cover the cage or perch with a cloth to make the bird feel safer.</p>
<h3 id="high-pitched-screams">HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS</h3>
<p>These screams may sound like the parakeets are singing. These are usually very short sounds and indicate that the bird is fine and calm.</p>
<p>This same noise can be used to ask for food, water or to get the owner&rsquo;s attention. But if the cries are loud and very high-pitched it could indicate that the bird is stressed, excited or scared.</p>
<h3 id="hissing">HISSING</h3>
<p>The parakeet makes a hissing sound to alert. This noise indicates a defensive posture of the bird or even that he is angry. He usually makes this sound to other birds as a warning.</p>
<p>Parakeets are very versatile when they make sounds. Above, we have listed just a few characteristic and very common sounds they emit. They practically have a language of their own that you can learn to communicate with your pet.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-summary">Conclusion and summary</h2>

<p>You have learned that the crackling of the beak making the clicking noise is natural for your bird. And he uses that sound when he&rsquo;s happy to see you and comfortable with your presence. You can even make the clicking noise back to the parakeet as a form of communication.</p>
